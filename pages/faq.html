                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that is used to develop a wide
                        range of applications. It is designed to be platform-independent, which means that Java code can
                        be run on any computer or mobile device without the need for specific hardware or software. Java
                        is widely used in industry, particularly in enterprise software development, mobile app
                        development, and web development. Learning Java can provide you with a solid foundation in
                        programming, which can help you build a career in the tech industry.</p>

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>To learn Java, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables,
                        data types, control structures, and functions. Familiarity with another programming language can
                        also be helpful, but it is not essential. Additionally, you will need a computer with a Java
                        Development Kit (JDK) installed, a code editor, and access to online resources and tutorials.
